        <img src="assets/css/images/img_0401.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="profile picture">

        <p>My name is Randy and I am originally from the beautiful state of 
        Nevada and I grew up in the "Biggest Little City in the World" Reno.
        My earliest childhood dreams were to experience and see the world and I got
        my wish by joining the United States Navy. My natual human nature is to help
        and heal people so I received my nursing and medical training by being a 
        Hospital Corpsman and I really enjoyed my different duty stations.
        </p>

        <p>My personal hobbies include, workin out at the gym and running by the beach,
            because I love being near the ocean. I enjoy listening to all types of music
            and I enjoyed playing my electric guitar playing rock music. I enjoy experiencing
            different food cuisines with Asian and Mexican food my favorites.
